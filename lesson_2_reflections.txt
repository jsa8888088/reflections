What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	It now becomes a git respository i.e. git would start keeping a meta deta for it

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	Staging area allows to add only those files from a repository that we want to commit
